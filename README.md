## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)

[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One of the challenges I faced while working on this game was determining where each function needed to be called. At one point in the example, they stopped showing the code and how it should be arranged, so I became a little hung up on the java function calling that dealt with light and sound. I wasn't sure where the functions were supposed to be placed, so I tried placing them in different areas to see if they mattered, and they did. So I just had to figure out a way to make it work and make sounds, but I'm not sure how the buttons would provide the user's clue to the colors they're supposed to click back, but other than that, I got the game to operate properly. I had to double-check the HTML part three or four times to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong with the buttons because I generally had incorrect spelling. Aside from that, I got the HTML section. I also had trouble linking the file to GitHub, but I figured out another way to do it that was much easier.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[One of my questions would be how does glitch link up HTML, CSS, and java in a way when you edit in their various files the work shows up on your website, so how are they basically linked was it done automatically already by glitch? apart from html and css what other language could we use to build a website like this? if we were to use any other language to build this game what would be the best lanugaue for this game?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time to work on this project, I would have made it more elaborate and intriguing. I think it's lovely and plain right now, but it's not that interesting because I'd get weary of staring at the colors. I would have included levels because I discovered that when games have levels and lives, they become more fascinating and people are challenged to play more, to get to a specific level, and they are more careful and concentrated with the lives they have on the game. Instead of merely random sounds, I could have an interesting sound.]
